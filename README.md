#  SQL Retail Store management Analysis

## Overview
This project explores a retail store's sales and customer data using SQL. It uses structured queries to analyze orders, customers, products, and order items, providing insights into business performance and customer behavior.

## Dataset Description
The analysis is based on four CSV files:
- `customers.csv` – Customer details including ID, age, gender, and city.
- `orders.csv` – Order-level data with customer ID, order date, and total amount.
- `order_items.csv` – Line-item level order details with quantity and unit price.
- `products.csv` – Product catalog with category and pricing.

## Key SQL Concepts Used
- **SELECT**, **WHERE**, **GROUP BY**, **HAVING**, **ORDER BY**
- **JOINs** (INNER, LEFT)
- **Aggregate functions**: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`
- **Filtering** by category, location, and date
- **CASE statements** for categorization (e.g., price range, age group)
- **UNION** operations

## Business Questions Answered
- Who are the top spending customers?
- What products generate the highest revenue?
- Which cities or age groups have the most orders?
- What are the most common order sizes and customer profiles?
- Which product categories are most popular?

##  Tools Used
